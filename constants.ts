export const SILENT_YODHA_PROMPT = `Create a 9:16 vertical cinematic short film (30 seconds) introducing “The Silent Yodha,” an anonymous Indian creator beginning his 90-day discipline journey.

Structure the film into 7 distinct cinematic scenes, each with unique camera motion, lighting, and pacing. Maintain a moody, cold, disciplined tone.

Use slow cinematic transitions between scenes — crossfades, slow pans, fog dissolves — not one static frame.

Scene 1 — Arrival (0:00–0:05)
Dawn. Hooded man walking through foggy street.
Camera pans from boots → silhouette.
Background: cold blue light + mist.
Sound: footsteps + wind.
VO: “Thand badh gayi hai…”

Scene 2 — Pause (0:05–0:08)
He stops, exhales. Fog around face.
Camera circles slowly from behind.
VO: “Par main rukne wala nahi.”

Scene 3 — Realization (0:08–0:12)
Close-up of breath, focus on hoodie texture.
Subtle bass rumble.
VO: “Motivation ek din ka hota hai.”

Scene 4 — Decision (0:12–0:16)
Tighten hoodie, slow head lift toward light.
VO: “Discipline har din ka.”

Scene 5 — Preparation (0:16–0:20)
Cut to close-ups: writing “Day 0 – The Beginning”, tying shoelaces, clenched fist.
VO: “Ye mera war hai.”

Scene 6 — March Forward (0:20–0:25)
Back-view tracking shot; walks into dense fog.
Overlay text:
“This is not motivation.”
“This is war.”
VO: “Main hoon — The Silent Yodha.”

Scene 7 — Call to Action (0:25–0:30)
He stops, slightly turns to camera (still faceless).
Fog thickens, fades to black.
Text: “⚔️ The Silent Yodha | 90 Days of Discipline | #WinterArc2025 ❄️”
VO: “Agar tu bhi chahta hai apni life badalna, to comment kar — ‘I’m in.’”

Cinematic Notes:
Aspect Ratio: 9:16
Duration: 30 seconds
Camera: slow zooms, depth-of-field, smooth transitions between scenes
Color Palette: dark grey, blue steel, soft orange highlights
Add film grain + fog movement + cinematic bass + faint heartbeat
Make sure each scene clearly changes in framing and motion
Keep pacing immersive and emotional like a Netflix intro trailer.
